You are expected to create container images, store the images in a repository, and configure a Cloud Build CI/CD pipeline to automate the build for the product. You know that your supervisor will ask you to complete these tasks:

1. Manual Build Docker Image: (read.me - step 1)
Create a Cloud Source Repository with your app (HTTP Server).
Add a Dockerfile file into your repository to build your app.
Test the created Docker image.
Push the Docker image into the Artifact Repository.

2. Automate Build Docker Image: (gen_infra.sh creates cloudbuild.yaml, need to setup Cloud Build)
Create a pipeline in Cloud Build to build a Docker image when the source code changes.

3. Manual Docker Image Deployment: (init_infra.sh creates k8s/ folder with deployment.yaml, need to setup k8s cluster)
Use the image to create a deployment in Kubernetes.
Update the image and apply the change of the deployment.

4. Automate Docker Image Deployment: (same as 2)
Create a pipeline in Cloud Build to deploy a new version of your image when the source code changes.

(done by init_infra.sh)
5. Expose your service over Cloud Load Balancer (Ingress) with an external static IP address:

(done by init_infra.sh)
6. Connect to Database using Cloud SQL Auth Proxy:
Create a Cloud SQL Database with a private IP address.
Connect the Application to the Database over the private IP address using Cloud SQL Auth Proxy.
Use Cloud Secret Manager & k8s secrets to store secret data.

(done by init_infra.sh)
7. Manual SQL migration scripts:
Create and apply SQL database migration scripts using one of database migration tools when the SQL database migration scripts add.
Connect the Migration Tool to the Database over the public IP address using Cloud SQL Auth Proxy.

(done by init_infra.sh)
8. Automate SQL migration scripts:
Create a pipeline in Cloud Build to apply database migration scripts.

Final Task:
After completing all tasks above you need to document what you did with 
diagrams that describe request flow, CI/CD flow, etc.
Connect with a peer member of GCP Developer Course.
Share the diagrams, do a call where you present your implementation and get feedback. 
After that attach your diagrams in.
